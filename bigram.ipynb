    "text=\"In statistics, a central tendency ( or measure of central tendency ) is a central or typical value for a probability distribution . [ 1 ] It may also be called a center or ! location of the distribution . Colloquially , measures of central tendency are often called averages . The term central tendency dates from the late 1920s . The most common measures of central tendency are the arithmetic mean , the median , and the mode. A middle tendency can be calculated for either a finite set of values or for a theoretical distribution , such as the normal distribution . Occasionally authors use central tendency to denote the tendency of quantitative data to cluster around some central value . The central tendency of a distribution is ? typically contrasted with its dispersion or variability ; dispersion and central tendency are the often characterized properties of distributions . Analysis may judge whether data has a strong or a weak central tendency based on its dispersion .\""
