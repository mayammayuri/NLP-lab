my blackest thoughts are reserved for those who borrow my books . I am unable to forgive a man
who fails to return a book he has taken from my shelf . I would not hesitate to tell him precisely what
I thought of him , if he would only give me a chance to speak , but as a general rule the book pirate
shows no inclination to continue his friendship with me ; he stoops beside his hedge and remains still
until I have safely passed his gate : if he meets me on the road face to face he doubles his pace with
an air of one going desperately in search of a doctor . it is a matter of life and death to someone , and
he has no time now to engage himself in any conversation centering round some miserable book
borrowed in a weak moment . This is the worst of the book pirate . he begins to feel that it was due
to some weakness that he ever entertained the idea of perusing such and such a book , while a busy
man like him could find no time to even read his ( neighbour â€™ s ) newspaper fully .
